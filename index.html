      <div class="col-5 text-about-reset">
        <p>Born in Phoenix, raised in Idaho. After high school I moved back
          to Phoenix to attend school at CRAS. Where I learned the art of audio engineering. After graduating I moved
          to Las Vegas to persue a career in live sound engineering with my friend from school. In Vegas I worked live sound
          and also started a band with my friend from CRAS. I started singing more often, as I was the vocalist for our
          death metal band Typhus.
        </p>
        <p>Two years into doing live sound I decided to make the change to working with production
          audio. So I moved here to California and I worked in Burbank as a production audio engineer.
          After doing that for a year I started my employement at Apple. At Apple I was in sales, shipping investigations and
          operations.
          Working at a location with a wide range of software developers as customers, I became very interested
          in software developement and technologies. That is why I am making this a goal to become a software engineer and
          create something that will help people all over the world.
